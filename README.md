# dlr-buttons

> Collection of React components for use as buttons

## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm i dlr-buttons
```

```js
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from 'dlr-buttons'

React.render( <Button />, document.body )
```

There’s also an example in the repo.

The buttons module does not provide a browser-ready version so you’ll need to use something like [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to get access to `require` but surely you’re doing something like that already?
